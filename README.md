# OmniLearning
Bridging the digital education gap between students, educators, and parents. Top 10 Hacks at CovLab Global Hackathon out of 137 submissions.

# Inspiration
There are thousands of online educational platforms. However, there isn't an easy way for parents, educators, and students to stay organized and engaged across the many different platforms. During no-school days such as the COVID19 lockdown, summers, or weekends, many students feel highly unmotivated without a rigid, organized schedule and a mentor to support them. OmniLearning, an iOS app, was inspired by these real-life issues.

# What it does
OmniLearning matches students with mentors and provides unique features for each respective user:

1) Students: receives updated personalized schedule curated by their mentors, stay organized with a schedule, increase productivity and motivation with a displayed reward, ask questions, update mentor with progress

2) Mentors (e.g. teachers, tutors, parents, older siblings): create and assign a personalized learning schedule across different platforms, send incentives and rewards as motivation, help students, receive real-time updates on students' progress
